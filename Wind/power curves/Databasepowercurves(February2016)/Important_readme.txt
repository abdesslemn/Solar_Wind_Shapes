This database of wind turbine power curves is for use with our WindPower program and
has been put together from a wide range of sources.

Whilst every effort has been made to accurately reproduce the data, it is important
that a user should not assume that the data reflects the most up-to-date information
on a particular power curve. Manufacturer's often improve the performance of their
turbines in incremental stages and so it is particularly important in deciding on a
choice of a turbine for a particular installation that a user should check that the manufacturer
has not produced a more recent power curve or that the turbine has been the subject of
a certification trial.
