Edited the Fortis Passaat wind turbine because it contained a comma and messed up with the code!
(replaced comma in file name and in file header to a dot)

Added the NREL power curves to the meta data file manually.
IF YOU RERUN SCRIPT YOU WILL LOSE THE METADATA ADDITION ON NREL POWER CURVES 
YOU WILL STILL HAVE THE MANUALLY ADDED CSVS WITH NREL POWER CURVES

Metadata for WTK NREL turbines is here:
NREL_1	3	25	100	2
NREL_2	3	25	100	2
