"(Feb 2015 notes - check for manufacturer's updates if the notes are more than about six months old)
http://www.vergnet.com

2-bladed downwind rotor with gearbox and hydraulic pitch control.

Hub height 55/60m - unsupported tubular mast
IEC class II to IV

(Manufacturer's estimates of EAP agree closely with those from the present program).

Identical performance to MP C model but tubular rather than a wire guyed mast."
