3-bladed upwind turbine with a tail fin. Speed control by variable pitch.

Tested to IEC 61400-12 standards in several countries. The efficiencies are reasonable and flat over a larger speed range than is usual. The manufacturer's annual energy production figures agree closely with those given by the present program."
