Dutch 2-blade wind turbine with speed and overload control via a mechanical blade pitch system. 

The power curve has apparently been measured by an independent organisation - Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands. It is therefore probably an accurate power curve and the efficiencies are certainly quite plausible with a peak value of around 35%.

Further confirmation of the relaibility of the data is that annual energy production calculations obtained from their webiste agree well with those obtained from the present program.

Prices excluding VAT are around £500,000 on a 39 metre tower."
