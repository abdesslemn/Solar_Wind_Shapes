3-blade upwind turbine with tail fin Various braking systems to prevent overload.

Power curve is from certification test by GL Garrad Hassan and so should be accurate. Data is available only up to 14 metres/sec and so data for higher speeds has been obtained from a linear extrapolation down to zero. The annual energy production (AEP) figures from the GL report are in close agreement with those from the present program up to a mean wind speed of about 7 metres/second but the present AEP at 10 metres/sec is about 15% higher probably because  data from the power curver for higher speeds has been included in the present estimates.
